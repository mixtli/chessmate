{The struggle between a bad bishop outside the pawn chain and a bad bishop
within the chain  While Black's bad Bishop has an open diagaonal at his
disposal, the White bad bishop is condemned to a very passive role. it is
plain that Black's advantage in mobility can be exploited only in the
middlegame. An endgame may well be drawn, since the Bishops control
opposite-coloured squares. It usual to speak of "unlike Bishops", or "Bishops
of opposite colours", although these expressions are not litereally correct. 
 Many players have a holy dread of such bishops, since in an ending it can
happen that an advantage of two or even three pawns may not suffice to force a
win. But before an ending the Gods have placed the middlegame as Dr. Tarrasch
often remarked. And this really is quite logical; the fact that the Bishops
work on opposite colours means that one can never defend what the other
attacks.    Black has attacking chances on the Kingside, and we see that
through the presence of the unlike Bishops the pressure on the White position
steadily increases.} 1... f4 {Prevents the development of the Bishop to e3 and

{Systematic use of the Bishop pair. Steinitz was the first to show a method
for the best utilization of the two Bishops. So far as is know, it was in the
present game that he first applied his system.  The theory of Steinitz applies
to positions which are not close, but which, on the other hand, are not yet
completely open in character. White still has support points at d4 and e5. The
cornerstone of the Steinitz system is to deprive the opponent of such support
points by means of pawn advances. The hostile pieces will thus be doomed to
passivity, and the owner of the bishop pair should not find it difficult to
set a decisive attack in motion. His contemporaries pointed out the weakness
which these pawn advances must necessarily creat. Only through the games of
Steinitz was it realized that such weaknesses are not so serious because two
bishops can cover all the squares, being in this way much more useful for
neutralizing weaknesses than two Knights or Knight and Bishop would be} 1... c5

{The Knights in a closed position  It is evident that in a struggle against
the Bishop pair the two Knights will do best in a closed position such as this
one. Moreover, in this case the presence of the support point at f4 is a
factor which strongly favours the Knights. The practical outcome of such a
position is that White will have to look for a favourable moment to exchange
one of his Bishops for a knight, bringing about a Bishop versus Knight
struggle} 1... Nf7 2. Qf3 Rae8 (2... -- {White has the choice of three schemes:
  1. He can exchange on Bishop at once (Bxf7) and then undertake the fight
with good Bishop (3. Pf3!) against Knight  2. He can exchange the other Bishop
for a Knight as soon as it appears on f4, but then he will have a Bad Bishop
against Knight.  3. he can leave things as they are and keep both Bishops; but
in this case he must work out some way of getting them into action.   Scheme 1
